                    <h3><a name="part-ii-b" tabindex="-1"></a>B. Rental Car Service Restrictions</h3>
                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle rentals available through this Site are subject to standard rental contracts of
                        the car rental companies, which will be completed by you at the time of pick-up of a
                        vehicle.</p>
                    <p>Charges for Taxes and Service Fees: In connection with facilitating your rental car
                        transaction, we will provide you with a breakdown of the estimated taxes, fees and
                        surcharges that may apply to your transaction. We will not charge you for these taxes,
                        fees and surcharges, but the car rental supplier will charge you taxes, fees and
                        surcharges at the time you rent your car.</p>
                    <h3><a name="part-ii-b" tabindex="-1"></a>Currency Conversion &amp; Charges</h3>
                    <p>The rate displayed is an estimate shown in US dollars. For non-prepaid rates for pick up
                        outside the US, you will be charged by the rental car provider in the local currency.
                        The rate charged by the local rental car provider may be determined by converting the US
                        dollar amount shown to you into the local currency at an exchange rate established by
                        the local rental car provider. Your credit or debit card company may convert that charge
                        in the rental car supplier’s local currency back into dollars (or your own local
                        currency if it is not dollars) at an exchange rate selected by it and additional fees
                        and surcharges may apply. Because conversion rates differ, the final charge to your
                        credit or debit card may be more than the estimated rate shown to you on priceline.com.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many rental companies operating in foreign countries may only accept payment in local
                        currency (not USD). Some may accept local currency cash while others may require you to
                        pay by credit or debit card in local currency.</p>
                    <h3><a name="part-ii-b" tabindex="-1"></a>Additional Insurance</h3>
                    <p>In certain non-US destinations, personal or third party liability insurance may be
                        required by law. Liability insurance provides you with minimum financial responsibility
                        limits as outlined in the applicable motor vehicle financial responsibility laws of the
                        country where the vehicle is operated. Third party liability insurance may be offered
                        for purchase by the local rental car company and may be required. The cost of purchasing
                        PLI varies and is not included in the rental charges shown on priceline.com. Collision
                        damage insurance (which is insurance for the vehicle and not personal or third party
                        liability insurance), or PLI that accompanies U.S. credit or debit cards may not be
                        acceptable forms of liability coverage. If you provide acceptable proof of current
                        liability coverage in a foreign country and you decline to purchase the liability
                        insurance offered by the local rental car company, an additional authorization amount
                        may be held on your credit card by the rental car company. Read the terms and conditions
                        from the rental car company applicable to your reservation for additional information.
