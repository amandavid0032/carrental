                      <p class="trustpilot-reviews-text">I could really choose my car from a variety of different makes
                        and vendors at rentalcars.com. They gave enough details about cars, so that I could make up my
                        mind about the type of vehicle I needed. Then I could pick out the best price among identical
                        cars offered and book. No prepayment was needed.
                        The rental company was very good and efficient. Their representative at Miami International
                        Airport office advised on all my questions, it was really helpful.
                        The car we got exceeded our expectations as it was brand new, clean and fully loaded KIA
                        Sportage, which we did not expect in Standard category.
                        Our drop-off was also easy but we had to turn-in the key at the sales office but not at the
                        parking floor as it was about 4 AM. So take into account, the drop-off procedure is a bit longer
                        at night. Just have extra spare time before your flight. :-)</p>
